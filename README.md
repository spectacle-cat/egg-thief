__YOU ARE A LIZARD__
_COLLECT EGGS. HIDE UNDER BUSHES. DO NOT GET EATEN._
(Beware the scorpions...)

A simple top down masocore game (you'll see why), where you have to figure out how to escape the level with all of the eggs without being MUNCHED by a predator.

There are 9 levels to get through - only the most determined can complete them!

### Controls
YES. Try it, it should work.

### How to play it?

If you have DragonRuby toolkit, pop this in the app folder and run the game.

If not, download it from itch.io: https://media-jousts.itch.io/egg-thief

### We made this as a family:

__Youngest Son:__ Level tester and came up with the scorpions idea, (possibly what makes this all fun)
__Eldest Son:__ Creature illustrations / Level designer
__Mother:__ Artwork / Design / Level designer
__Husband:__ Coder / SFX & Music (what sounds you ask? ha ha ha - someone's getting fired! :/ )

Hope you enjoy this little nature inspired game.

This game took us 4 months to build, with just a few hours here and there and long periods without doing anything, oof!

### Is it finished?

We were going to add more levels, a 3-star system for timing, new habitats, a story and wayyyyy more but we thought it's time to move on and take everything we learned from OUR FIRST GAME (omg we made something) and start iterating on that knowledge for more projects.

Very proud of the family for getting this done. Maybe it'll turn into an easter tradition to add more levels.

Let us know what you think!
