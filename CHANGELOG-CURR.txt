   Source code for ~GTK::Runtime::Notify~ in =./docs/oss.txt=.
** [OSS] Open sourced ~$gtk.process_argsv~
   Source code for ~GTK::Runtime::ProcessARGSV~ in =./docs/oss.txt=.
** [OSS] Updated the following docs based on feedback in #oss-docs-contributions:

** [Samples] Sample app added that shows how to create an animation queue.
   An animation queue is useful for visual effects such as a particle system.
   Location of sample: =samples/08_tweening_lerping_easing_functions/06_animation_queues=
** [Samples] Added sample app that shows how to do a very simple AABB collision.
   Location of sample: =./samples/04_physics_and_collisions/01_simple_aabb_collision_with_map_editor=

** [Samples] Added sample app that shows ramp collision.
   This sample app uses the new replay capabilities ~$gtk.replay_and_reset "replay.txt", speed: 2~. A replay
   file is included with the sample so you can see how changing parts of the code affects collision.
   Location of sample: =samples/04_physics_and_collisions/12_ramp_collision=
** [Support] Added ~args.state.geometry.find_all_intersect_rect(rect, rects)~
   Similar to ~args.state.geometry.find_intersect_rect~ but returns a collection opposed to just the first collision. This function is implemented in C.
** [Support] Major enhancements to recording and replay functionality.
*** ~$recording.on_replay_tick &block~ and ~$recording.on_recording_tick &block~ functions:
    These functions can be used to execute code while a recording or replay is executing.

    Example:

    #+begin_src
      def tick args
        ....
      end

      $recording.on_replay_tick do |args|
        # code will be called after each tick of a replay
      end

      $recording.on_recording_tick do |args|
        # code will be called after each tick of a recording
      end
    #+end_src
*** ~$gtk.reset_and_replay FILE, speed: (1 - 7)
    Calling this function at the bottom of a file (outside of tick) will automatically reset your game and run the replay.

    Example:

    #+begin_src
      def tick args
        ....
      end

      # record a replay via the Console by using the menu item or running ~$record.start_recording SEED_NUMBER~.
      # after your recording has been saved, you can use the following line to autoplay the recording
      # on file save
      $gtk.reset_and_replay "replay.txt", speed: 2
    #+end_src
*** ~$recording.start_replay~ accepts a ~speed:~ parameter.
    From the console you can run ~$recording.start_replay FILE, speed: 2~. The maximum replay speed is ~7~.

   Example:

   #+begin_src
    def tick args
      args.state.box ||= {
        x: 0,
        y: 0,
        w: 40,
        h: 40
      }

      final_x = 1240
      final_y = 680

      # if space key is pressed, start animation
      if args.inputs.keyboard.key_down.space
        args.state.animation_start_at = args.state.tick_count
      end

      progress_x = 0
      progress_y = 0

      if args.state.animation_start_at
        perc = args.easing.ease args.state.animation_start_at,     # start tick
                                args.state.tick_count,             # current tick
                                60,                                # duration
                                :smooth_stop_quint                 # easing definition

        progress_x = final_x * perc
        progress_y = final_y * perc
      end

      args.outputs.solids << {
        x: progress_x,
        y: progress_y,
        w: 40,
        h: 40
      }
    end
   #+end_src
* 4.4
** [Bugfix] Triangle rendering of solids respects r,g,b values.
* 4.3
** [Bugfix] Simpler encoding of a game's web-build working directory.
* 4.2
** [Bugfix] Update to web-based builds to remove offset within the Itch.io iFrame. This is definitely maybe fixed this time.
** [Bugfix] Ensure that a game's web-build working directory is unique from game to game.
* 4.1
** [Bugfix] Update to web-based builds to remove offset within the Itch.io iFrame.
* 4.0
** [BREAKING] This release contains two very minor breaking changes (don't panic).
   1. ~args.inputs.mouse.point~ no longer returns a ~Tuple/Array~ and
      instead returns a ~Hash~ with ~x~ and ~y~ keys.

      NOTE: You will ONLY see an issue with this change if you were
      destructing the ~Tuple~.

      Lines like the following:

      #+begin_src ruby
        # destructure tuple no longer supported
        x, y = args.inputs.mouse.point
      #+end_src

      Must be changed to:

      #+begin_src ruby
        # Hash is returned (which cannot be destructured)
        point = args.inputs.mouse.point
        x, y = point.x, point.y
      #+end_src

   2. ~args.inputs.directional_vector~ has a similar change and can no longer
       be destructured.

   That's it for the breaking changes!
** [Pro] [iOS] C Extensions fixed so that they are accepted by TestFlight.
   A sample app has been added that shows how to package C Extensions for iOS:
   =/samples/12_c_extensions/05_ios_c_extensions/=
** [Pro] [Android] Android SDK target is now version 33 (android-ndk-r25b).
** [Bugfix] [Pro] ~all_screen_max_scale~ in combination with ~highdpi~ is respected for both
   landscape and portrait games.
** [Samples] Turn based RPG sample app has been added.
   The sample app is located at: =./samples/99_genre_rpg_turn_based/turn_based_battle=.
** [Performance] Performance improvements to ~Entities~.
   Both ~args.state.new_entity~ and ~args.state.new_entity_strict~
   have gotten some performance improvements. The perf boost to
   ~new_entity_strict~ is significant.
** [Performance] [Support] ~args.gtk.warn_array_primitives!~ added.
   While array based primitives are simple to create, they come with a performance
   penalty. If you find that you're having performance issues, you can use ~warn_array_primitives~
   to find places in your code where array primitives are used/created
   (so you can convert them to ~Hashes~):

   #+begin_src ruby
     def tick args
       # add this line to the top of your tick method
       args.gtk.warn_array_primitives!

       # a log entry will be printed to the Console anywhere array primitives are being used

       # example
       args.outputs.labels << [100, 100, "Hello"]

       # example
       rect_1 = [10, 100, 50, 50]
       rect_2 = [10, 100, 50, 50]
       args.geometry.intersect_rect? rect_1, rect_2
     end
   #+end_src
** [Support] Added out of bounds warning for sprite's ~(source|tile)_(x|y|w|h)~ properties.
   You will be warned if a specified source/tile rect goes past the boundaries of a sprite.
